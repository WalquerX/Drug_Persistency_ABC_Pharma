# Project Name
Persistency of a drug prediction model.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
This project was the final assigment as Data Scientist interns at [Data Glacier ](https://www.dataglacier.org/).

The project aim was to carry out an analysis in order to have an understanding on the persistence of taking of a drug they released to market. The aim is to know if a patient, based on his/her information, will follow the prescription of the physician and continue taking the drug for all the treatment time. We have been provided with a dataset with patientsâ€™ details.

### Methods Used

* Heroku

## Project Description

The client was a pharmaceutical Company. We were trying to develop a model that predicts if a patient will stick or not to the prescriptions of his/her physician on taking an specific drug owned by the company.

Since what we were looking for was a model that separates in categories the patients based on their information, we choose classification model as a solution. 

Our aim was to develop a web app that could be used by the company to predict if a patient will follow or not with the drug taking schedule.

Folders separate project deliverables in stages.

In each of them there is a pdf report with more details.

In folder 13 you will find the final presentation of the results of the selection of the model and the deployment.
